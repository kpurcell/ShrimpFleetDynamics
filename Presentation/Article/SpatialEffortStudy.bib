	ecological and economic species in the eastern Bering Sea, yet detailed
	synthesis of the spatial and temporal patterns of pollock ichthyoplankton
	in this important region is lacking. This knowledge gap is particularly
	severe considering that egg and larval distribution are essential
	to reconstructing spawning locations and early life stages drift
	pathways. We used 19Â yr of ichthyoplankton collections to determine
	the spatial and temporal patterns of egg and larval distribution.
	Generalized additive models ({GAMs)} identified two primary temporal
	pulses of pollock eggs, the first occurring from 20 February to 31
	March and the second from 20 April to 20 May; larvae showed similar,
	but slightly lagged, pulses. Based on generalized cross-validation
	and information theory, a {GAM} model that allowed for different
	seasonal patterns in egg density within three unique areas outperformed
	a {GAM} that assumed a single fixed seasonal pattern across the entire
	eastern Bering Sea. This â€˜area-dependentâ€™ {GAM} predicted the
	highest densities of eggs (i.e., potential spawning locations) in
	three major areas of the eastern Bering Sea: near Bogoslof Island
	({Februaryâ€“April)}, north of Unimak Island and the Alaska Peninsula
	({Marchâ€“April)}, and around the Pribilof Islands ({Aprilâ€“August).}
	Unique temporal patterns of egg density were observed for each area,
	suggesting that pollock spawning may be more spatially and temporally
	complex than previously assumed. Moreover, this work provides a valuable
	baseline of pollock spawning to which future changes, such as those
	resulting from climate variability, may be compared.},

  abstract = {Abstract Unraveling the diverse forces controlling the abundance and
	distribution of fish across a landscape has been challenging, in
	part because few techniques exist to address multiple factors simultaneously
	in a single analysis. We used spatially explicit, varying-coefficient
	generalized additive models to relate the summertime abundance and
	distribution of yellow perch Perca flavescens to a variety of predatory,
	water quality, landscape, and density-dependent factors. The model
	used 25 years of fishery-independent trawling data from southern
	Green Bay, Lake Michigan, an area that supported major fisheries
	for yellow perch until their decline in the 1990s. Local catch per
	unit effort ({CPUE)} of both age-0 and age-1 and older yellow perch
	was affected by the abundance of double-crested cormorants Phalacrocorax
	auritus, dissolved oxygen, water clarity, and bottom depth, but not
	water temperature. In addition, the local response of age-0 yellow
	perch {CPUE} to most predictor variables, including their own global
	density, had a unique spatial structure. For instance, increased
	cormorant abundance was related to declines in local yellow perch
	{CPUE}, especially near cormorant nesting islands, while increased
	dissolved oxygen levels were correlated with increased local yellow
	perch {CPUE} in shallow nearshore areas of southern Green Bay. In
	addition, local yellow perch {CPUE} increased near the mouth of the
	Fox River during years with higher water clarity, suggesting that
	water quality may be limiting to yellow perch in this region. Our
	results suggest that it is important to explicitly account for the
	different ways in which predictor variables influence fish abundance
	across the aquatic landscape. Received June 23, 2010; accepted February

  abstract = {{ABSTRACT:} Certain ecological processes dominate others at particular
	scales, and the response of populations to exogenous and endogenous
	forces are typically scale dependent. In spite of this central role
	played by scale, the temporal and spatial scales of human impacts
	on ecosystems and populations remain almost unknown. We applied a
	multiscale regression analysis to investigate the spatiotemporal
	scales which characterize the fisheries exploitation of yellowfin
	sole Limanda aspera in the Bering Sea. We found that harvesting affects
	the abundance of this species simultaneously at local and regional
	scales. At the local scale harvesting produced a negative effect
	on local fish densities, particularly in those areas and seasons
	of high fish aggregation, when both the vulnerability of the fish
	and the fishing effort increase. At the regional scale harvesting
	was characterized by a widespread negative effect on the whole fish
	population. Our findings demonstrate that (1) detection of the fisheries
	exploitation effects on natural populations is sensitive to the scale
	of investigation, (2) fisheries harvesting can simultaneously affect
	multiple ecological scales which are not linearly correlated with
	each other. We developed analytical techniques for the detection
	of scale-dependent processes, which can be readily applied to other
	systems. Our results provide insights on the risks of extrapolating
	the effects of harvesting on natural populations across scales, making
	the issues of scale and space central to the management and conservation
	of natural populations.},

  abstract = {The Mississippi River is one of the world's 10 largest rivers, with
	average freshwater discharge into the northern Gulf of Mexico ({GOM)}
	of 380 km3 yearâˆ’ 1. In the northern {GOM}, anthropogenic nitrogen
	is primarily derived from agricultural fertilizer and delivered via
	the Mississippi River. The general consensus is that hypoxia in the
	northern Gulf of Mexico is caused primarily by algal production stimulated
	by excess nitrogen delivered from the {Mississippiâ€“Atchafalaya}
	River Basin and seasonal vertical stratification of incoming stream
	flow and Gulf waters, which restricts replenishment of oxygen from
	the atmosphere. In this paper, we review the controversial aspects
	of the largely nutrient-centric view of the hypoxic region, and introduce
	the role of non-riverine organic matter inputs as other oxygen-consuming
	mechanisms. Similarly, we discuss non-nutrient physically-controlled
	impacts of freshwater stratification as an alternative mechanism
	for controlling in part, the seasonality of hypoxia. We then explore
	why hypoxia in this dynamic river-dominated margin ({RiOMar)} is
	not comparable to many of the other traditional estuarine systems
	(e.g., Chesapeake Bay, Baltic Sea, and Long Island Sound). The presence
	of mobile muds and the proximity of the Mississippi Canyon are discussed
	as possible reasons for the amelioration of hypoxia (e.g., healthy
	fisheries) in this region. The most recent prediction of hypoxia
	area for 2009, using the current nutrient-centric models, failed
	due to the limited scope of these simple models and the complexity
	of this system. Predictive models should not be the main driver for
	management decisions. We postulate that a better management plan
	for this region can only be reached through a more comprehensive
	understanding of this {RiOMar} systemâ€”not just more information
	on river fluxes (e.g., nutrients) and coastal hypoxia monitoring
	programs.},

  abstract = {Abstract Fisheries of enclosed and semiâ€?enclosed seas provide the
	first basis for evaluating human impacts on marine ecosystems. These
	have become of serious concern before similar changes are detectable
	in oceanic systems, thus emphasizing their value as laboratories
	for comparative study of manâ€?induced changes. The paper discusses
	the relevance of the cline, oligoâ€?mesoâ€?euâ€?dysâ€?trophic to
	stressed marine systems, and focuses on impacts on fisheries of enhanced
	nutrient runoff, noting common features with marine systems subject
	to natural enrichment, but also with wellâ€?studied freshwater systems.
	It is suggested that under nutrient enrichment and heavy fishing,
	both â€œtop downâ€?; and â€œbottom upâ€?; trophic mechanisms act
	in synchrony to change the trophic chain, leading initially to increased
	fishery productivity of formerly oligotrophic systems, followed by
	more drastic and negative changes as nutrient input passes beyond
	a state that may be called mesotrophic. Nutrient enrichment and overfishing
	have similar and synergistic effects: a decline in diversity, an
	initial increase in productivity of benthic/demersal and pelagic
	food webs, then the progressive dominance of the production system
	by shortâ€?lived, especially pelagic, species. The separation of
	these two anthropogenic effects on semiâ€?enclosed seas is difficult
	and has been confounded by the synchronous growth of industrial fishing,
	and of downstream impacts of growing populations, industrialization
	and agroâ€?industry, and growing water usage, especially since World
	War {II.} A description of human impacts on several semiâ€?enclosed
	seas emphasizes the Marine Catchment Basin ({MCB)} concept, noting
	that ranking by the relative extents of catchment area and marine
	basin explains much of the observed impact. A systems approach to
	management of inland and coastal seas is suggested, with priority
	on the control of nutrient flows between terrestrial and aquatic
	systems, and the establishment of accurate statistical systems integrating
	fisheries and environmental data over whole basins and coastal seas.},

	and ecological research to further our understanding of how fish
	distribute and survive in space. This review serves a dual purpose
	by emphasizing the scientific importance of studying spatial interactions
	to better understand the temporal dynamics of fish abundance, and
	by promoting the development of new analytical and ecological approaches
	for the analysis of spatial data. Through our survey we cover different
	statistical techniques, marine ecosystems and life stages. This analytical,
	geographic and ontogenetic variety is also purposely selected to
	highlight the importance of comparative and multidisciplinary studies
	across diverging ecological disciplines, ecosystems and life stages.
	Besides having a general ecological relevance this review also bears
	a more applied significance, owing to the increasing need for protecting
	renewable marine resources along with their primary habitat.},

	the dynamics of habitat selection for both prey species and their
	mobile predators. In a review of marsh ecosystems, we found that
	little information is currently available with which to evaluate
	potential mechanisms underlying patterns of habitat use in these
	systems. Though marshes are widely considered important for foraging
	and predator refuge, this function has rarely been measured or critically
	evaluated. In contrast, measurement has focused on abiotic factors,
	resulting in a mismatch between factors cited as important and those
	actually measured. Existing theory on habitat selection in fishes
	combined with the strong empirical base that has been developed on
	patterns of habitat use in marsh fishes provides a unique opportunity
	to begin testing relevant mechanisms underlying distributional patterns.
	A mechanistic approach is necessary to understand the functional

	be minimized to levels approaching insignificance. This view, as

	the widely held belief that discarded portions of fishery catches
	(including economic resources, protected species, and unobserved
	mortalities of animals not caught) represent an unacceptable waste
	of natural resources. Bycatches in their various forms can have significant
	consequences for populations, food webs, and ecosystems. The economic
	effects of bycatches can influence not only the levels of yields
	to individual fisheries, but also may have major effects on allocations
	among competing fisheries. The lack of comprehensive monitoring programs
	in most areas to assess bycatches and integrate them into population
	and multispecies models seriously impedes a full understanding of
	bycatch consequences and the efficacy of measures for their amelioration.
	Nevertheless, where evidence for significant bycatches exists, a
	risk-averse and perhaps adaptive management philosophy is clearly
	warranted. Establishing the benefits and costs associated with bycatch
	management is a priority as managers attempt to define the practicality
	of bycatches approaching zero given the institutional, scientific,
	and industry resources necessary to accomplish the job.},

  abstract = {Bycatch of unwanted, prohibited, or protected species is a problem
	in most commercial fisheries. Trawl fisheries are particularly prone
	to bycatch problems because trawls are not species-selective. In
	this paper, I review the history of finfish bycatch research in the
	Gulf of Mexico shrimp trawl fishery and explore the use of quotas
	to reduce finfish bycatch by examining four fisheries that currently
	use bycatch quotas: (1) the arrow squid trawl fishery of New Zealand,
	which uses fleet bycatch quotas for sea lion bycatch, (2) the Alaskan
	groundfish trawl fisheries, which use fleet quotas under a â€œvessel
	incentive programâ€? for prohibited species, (3) the groundfish trawl
	fishery of British Columbia, Canada which uses individual vessel
	bycatch quotas for prohibited species, and (4) the multi-species
	trawl fisheries of New Zealand, which use catch balancing, or individual
	transferable quotas, for most commercially landed species. Based
	on the bycatch quota experiences in these fisheries, elements of
	successful bycatch quota programs include: (1) individual accountability,
	in the form of individual or cooperative bycatch quotas, rather than
	fleet quotas, (2) 100\% observer coverage, (3) relatively small,
	manageable fleets, (4) limited landing ports that can be easily monitored,
	particularly if observer coverage is incomplete, (5) reliable enforcement,
	(6) penalties that are true disincentives, and (7) some flexibility
	in the system for fishermen to have alternatives to manage their
	bycatch. The Gulf of Mexico shrimp trawl fishery, with an estimated
	20,000 licensed boats, is currently too large for individual bycatch
	quotas to be practical, although individual or cooperative bycatch
	quotas would be excellent strategies for reducing the bycatch of
	a smaller fleet. Mobile closed areas might be beneficial for reducing
	the bycatch of particular species, but these short-term closures
	would require real-time monitoring of bycatch rates and vessel monitoring
	systems on all vessels. However, under any management regime, incentives
	and/or rigorously enforced disincentives are the key to successful
	bycatch reduction.},

	attributed to downcoast (southwestward) advection of waters from
	the {Mississippiâ€“Atchafalaya} River system. Here, we present evidence
	for a hypoxic event on the inner shelf of Texas coincident with the
	presence of freshwater linked to high flow of the Brazos River in
	Texas. These conclusions are based on hydrographic observations and
	isotopic measurements of waters on the inner shelf near the Brazos
	River mouth. These data characterize the development, breakdown,
	and dispersal of a hypoxic event lasting from June through September
	2007 off the Texas coast. Oxygen isotope compositions of shelf water
	indicate that (1) discharge from the Brazos River was the principal
	source of freshwater and water column stratification during the 2007
	event, and (2) during low Brazos River discharge in 2008, freshwater
	on the Texas shelf was derived mainly from the {Mississippiâ€“Atchafalaya}
	River System. Based on these findings, we conclude that the {Mississippiâ€“Atchafalaya}
	River System is not the sole cause of hypoxia in the northern Gulf

	regarding factors that dictate local speciesâ€™ densities. We anticipated
	persistent effects of hypoxia (felt even when seasonal hypoxia was
	absent) on species densities would be most pronounced for sessile
	species, but that immediate effects (felt only when seasonal hypoxia
	was present) would dominate for mobile species. Conventional analysis
	provided strong evidence that densities of sessile species were persistently
	reduced in the hypoxic-impacted site, but did not indicate widespread
	immediate density responses during hypoxic events among mobile species.
	The absence of strong weights of evidence for hypoxia effects was
	partly a consequence of alternative hypotheses that better explained
	spatial-temporal variation in speciesâ€™ densities. The hierarchical
	ensemble analysis improved the precision of species-specific effect
	sizes, and also allowed us to make inferences about the response
	of aggregated groups of species. The estimated mean density reductions
	during hypoxic events (dissolved oxygen {\textasciitilde}2 mg/l)
	ranged from 73 to 98\% among mobile invertebrates, benthic, and benthopelagic
	fishes. The large reduction in benthic and benthopelagic species
	suggests substantial effects of hypoxia in Hood Canal even at oxygen
	levels that were marginally hypoxic. Understanding the full ecological
	consequence of hypoxia will require a greater knowledge on the spatial
	extent of distributional shifts and their effects on competitive
	and predatorâ€“prey interactions.},

	spatial patterns of fishing effort, based on nothing more than the
	position of the vessel at 10-min intervals; these algorithms were
	tested with 788 tows (4,558 h of trawling). On average, the difference
	between {ELB} estimates and recorded levels of effort were less than
	1\%; spatial agreement was also good. On a spatial basis, {ELB} estimates
	accounted for more than 84â€“97\% of the variance observed in recorded
	effort, depending on the grid size used in the analysis. Further,
	analysis of data from more than 18,000 tows yielded a strong within-trip
	relationship between catch and effort. This relationship enables
	accurate allocation of the total landings from a trip to the subareas
	fished, based on nothing more than trawling times within each subarea
	fished. Because National Marine Fisheries Service port agents already
	collect landings on a trip total basis, a large-scale installation
	of inexpensive ({\textless}{US\$500)} {ELB} units should be able
	to measure shrimp fishing effort accurately.},

	one or more of the 219 statistical area-depth zone cells for which
	a catch rate (pounds per nominal day fished or catch per unit effort
	({CPUE))} is also obtained. Each month, the total landings in pounds
	for each cell are divided by the {CPUE} of the cell to determine
	effort or days fished. These values are summed across all cells and
	months to provide an estimate of total effort. The accuracy of total
	effort estimates is directly proportional to the accuracy of the
	landings allocations and estimated {CPUE} values. It has been assumed
	that allocation errors are random and that directional bias is negligible.
	In a previous paper, we described an electronic logbook ({ELB)} that
	enables accurate measurement of the spatial patterns of fishing effort.
	Herein, we provide comparisons of actual areas fished, pounds landed,
	and catch rates as measured with {ELBs} to the corresponding estimates
	made by {NMFS} port agents. The results show that directional bias
	occurs and that {CPUE} is often underestimated. Based on 135 trip
	comparisons, midshelf effort in 2000 was greatly overestimated, whereas
	nearshore and deepwater effort was substantially underestimated.
	If our effort results are representative, present estimates of the
	bycatch of midshelf species may therefore be greatly overestimated,
	whereas the converse may be true for nearshore and deepwater species.
	We suggest that a cooperative program involving both {NMFS} and industry
	should be implemented based on {ELB} technology and the port agent
	network to obtain more precise and accurate estimates of shrimp trawling
	effort with minimal impact on the fishers.},

	Model input variables were derived from two load estimation methods,
	the adjusted maximum likelihood estimation ({AMLE)} and the composite
	({COMP)} method, developed by the {U.S.} Geological Survey. Variability
	in midsummer hypoxic area was described by models that incorporated
	May discharge, May nitrate, and February {TP} concentrations or their
	spring (discharge and nitrate) and winter ({TP)} averages. The regression
	models predicted the observed hypoxic area within Â±30\%, yet model
	residuals showed an increasing trend with time. An additional model
	variable, Epoch, which allowed post-1993 observations to have a different
	intercept than earlier observations, suggested that hypoxic area
	has been 6450 km2 greater per unit discharge and nutrients since
	1993. Model forecasts predicted that a dual 45\% reduction in nitrate
	and {TP} concentration would likely reduce hypoxic area to approximately
	5000 km2, the coastal goal established by the Mississippi {River/Gulf}
	of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force. However, the {COMP} load
	estimation method, which is more accurate than the {AMLE} method,
	resulted in a smaller predicted hypoxia response to any given nutrient
	reduction than models based on the {AMLE} method. Monte Carlo simulations
	predicted that five years after an instantaneous 50\% nitrate reduction
	or dual 45\% nitrate and {TP} reduction it would be possible to resolve
	a significant reduction in hypoxic area. However, if nutrient reduction
	targets were achieved gradually (e.g., over 10 years), much more
	than a decade would be required before a significant downward trend
	in both nutrient concentrations and hypoxic area could be resolved
	against the large background of interannual variability. The multiple
	regression models and statistical approaches applied provide improved
	capabilities for evaluating dual nutrient management strategies to

	and hydrographical changes of the Louisiana Shelf, and possibly coastal
	erosion of wetlands in southern Louisiana. In order to track the

	faunal proxy, the {PEB} index, which has been shown statistically
	to represent the modern Louisiana hypoxia zone. We constructed a
	network of 13 {PEB} records with excess {210Pb-derived} chronologies
	to establish the development of low-oxygen and hypoxic conditions
	over a large portion of the modern dead zone for the last 100 years.
	The {PEB} index record indicates that areas of low-oxygen bottom
	water began to appear in the early 1910s in isolated hotspots near
	the Mississippi Delta and rapidly expanded across the entire Louisiana
	shelf beginning in the 1950s. Since {\textasciitilde}1950, the percentage
	of {PEB} species has steadily increased over a large portion of the
	modern dead zone. By 1960, subsurface low-oxygen conditions were
	occurring seasonally over a large part of the geographic area now
	known as the dead zone. The long-term trends in the {PEB} index are

	fish resources, considerable attention has been paid to the development
	of models explaining how fish stocks change over space and time.
	In most models, fishing effort is assumed to be exogenous and determined
	by factors such as management. Increasingly, there has been a call
	for bio-economic models to also account for the dynamics of fishing
	fleets, recognizing that fishers respond to changing environmental,
	institutional and economic conditions. A growing literature has sought
	to explicitly model the endogenous determinants of the capacity of
	fishing fleets, the intensity of its use and its temporal and spatial
	allocation across fishing opportunities. We review this literature,
	focusing on empirical applications of the behavioural models that
	have been put forward to explain and predict observed fleet dynamics.
	We find that although economic factors are usually included as a
	dominant driver in most studies, this is often based on the use of
	proxy variables for the key economic drivers, for which adequate
	data are lacking. Also, while many studies acknowledge that social
	and socialâ€“psychological factors play a significant role in explaining
	observed fishing behaviour, their inclusion in fishing fleet dynamic
	models is still very limited. Progress in this domain can only be

	Spatial and temporal variability in the distribution of hypoxic water

	The Mississippi River flood in 1993 and sustained freshwater inputs

	when long-term mean flows (1930â€“1995) are normally lowest. Long-term
	studies of the Louisiana shelf hypoxic zone provided a natural experiment
	to examine the effects of extreme high river flow on the adjacent
	continental shelf. Oxygen levels in bottom waters were severely reduced
	in July, August and September compared to long-term averages (1985â€“1992).
	Also, the areal extent of the bottom-water hypoxia in mid-summer
	1993 was approximately twice as large as the average area mapped
	in the previous 8 years during mid-summer shelfwide surveys. Contributing
	to increased severity and areal extent of hypoxia in 1993 were reduced

  abstract = {Hypoxia is often associated with increasing nutrient loadings and
	has clear mortality effects on sessile organisms, but its population
	effects on mobile organisms in coastal environments are uncertain.
	The evidence for hypoxia having population level effects is laboratory
	experiments, many examples of localized effects in nature, a few
	population-level examples, fish kills, and intuition. Despite the
	perception by many people, none of these provide conclusive evidence
	of widespread population responses to hypoxia. We synthesize the
	results from seven ecological simulation models that examined how
	low dissolved oxygen ({DO)} affected fish at the individual, population,
	and community levels. These models represent a variety of species,
	simulate the dynamics at a range of temporal scales and spatial scales,
	and impose a variety of subsets of possible {DO} effects. Several
	patterns emerged from the accumulated results. First, predicted responses
	were large in simpler models, and small to large in more complex
	models. Second, while the main effects of increased hypoxia were
	generally small to moderate, there were instances of relatively large
	indirect effects and interaction effects. Indirect effects involved
	growth and mortality responses due to altered spatial distribution
	(rather than due directly to {DO)} and food web interactions. Interaction
	effects were larger responses to hypoxia when other factors were
	at certain levels (e.g., responses at low versus high fish densities).
	Interactions also occurred when the predicted responses were larger
	than would be expected by the sum of the separate effects. Third,
	accurate information on exposure and degree of avoidance of low {DO}
	were critical unknowns. Our interpretations should be viewed as suggestive
	rather than definitive. The patterns described were based on a collection
	of modeling results that were not designed to be compared to each
	other. A quick look at other models seems to confirm our patterns,
	or at minimum, does not contradict our patterns. Quantifying the
	effects of hypoxia on fish populations, whether large or small, is
	critical for effective management of coastal ecosystems and for cost-effective
	and efficient design of remediation actions. The potential for interaction
	and indirect effects complicates field study and management. Improving
	our predictions of the effects of hypoxia on fish populations and
	communities has moved from a computational issue to a biological
	issue. We seem to be making progress on monitoring and modeling movement
	behavior, but progress is slower in food web theory and empirical
	research and in quantifying interspecific interactions and habitat

	of statistical regression models implement general maximum likelihood
	estimation and smoothing. The {VGLM/VGAM} framework is very general
	and is shown to include many popular fisheries regression models
	such as {GLMs} and {GAMs}, the negative binomial ({NB)}, the zero-inflated
	Poisson ({ZIP)} and {ZINB}, the zero-altered Poisson ({ZAP)} and
	{ZANB} as special cases. The primary purpose of this article is to
	introduce the {VGLM/VGAM} methodology into fisheries science. To
	this end, data from the 2008 {FIPS-MOUCHE} World Fly Fishing Championships
	is used to illustrate the chief advantages of the framework, viz.
	its large size and its ability to fit each model in a very flexible
	manner. Having a large framework leads to greater efficiencies in
	the practical modelling of data. The specific questions examined
	fall under two categories: (i) what distribution do the fish lengths
	have in each of the sectors? (ii) can fish catch reduction be detected
	and if so, how can the effects be ameliorated? As well as the above
	models, the utility of several other seemingly disparate regression
	models to fisheries research are presented, such as the bivariate
	odds-ratio model, the generalized extreme value distribution, and
	several quantile regression techniques.},

	Taking the case of population dynamics, I point out that there are
	several very general law-like propositions that provide the theoretical
	basis for most population dynamics models that were developed to
	address specific issues. Some of these foundational principles, like
	the law of exponential growth, are logically very similar to certain
	laws of physics (Newton's law of inertia, for example, is almost
	a direct analogue of exponential growth). I discuss two other principles
	(population self-limitation and resource-consumer oscillations),
	as well as the more elementary postulates that underlie them. None
	of the â€œlawsâ€? that I propose for population ecology are new.
	Collectively ecologists have been using these general principles
	in guiding development of their models and experiments since the
	days of Lotka, Volterra, and Gause.},

  abstract = {Chaotic ecological dynamic systems defy conventional statistical analysis.
	Systems with near-chaotic dynamics are little better. Such systems
	are almost invariably driven by endogenous dynamic processes plus
	demographic and environmental process noise, and are only observable
	with error. Their sensitivity to history means that minute changes
	in the driving noise realization, or the system parameters, will
	cause drastic changes in the system trajectory1. This sensitivity
	is inherited and amplified by the joint probability density of the
	observable data and the process noise, rendering it useless as the
	basis for obtaining measures of statistical fit. Because the joint
	density is the basis for the fit measures used by all conventional
	statistical methods2, this is a major theoretical shortcoming. The
	inability to make well-founded statistical inferences about biological
	dynamic models in the chaotic and near-chaotic regimes, other than
	on an ad hoc basis, leaves dynamic theory without the methods of
	quantitative validation that are essential tools in the rest of biological
	science. Here I show that this impasse can be resolved in a simple
	and general manner, using a method that requires only the ability
	to simulate the observed data on a system from the dynamic model
	about which inferences are required. The raw data series are reduced
	to phase-insensitive summary statistics, quantifying local dynamic
	structure and the distribution of observations. Simulation is used
	to obtain the mean and the covariance matrix of the statistics, given
	model parameters, allowing the construction of a â€˜synthetic likelihoodâ€™
	that assesses model fit. This likelihood can be explored using a
	straightforward Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, but one further
	post-processing step returns pure likelihood-based inference. I apply
	the method to establish the dynamic nature of the fluctuations in
	Nicholsonâ€™s classic blowfly experiments3, 4, 5.},

	and causes a deterioration of the structure and function of ecosystems.
	Based on the collective contributions of members of {SCOR} Working
	Group \#128, the present study provides an overview of the major
	aspects of coastal hypoxia in different biogeochemical provinces,
	including estuaries, coastal waters, upwelling areas, fjords and
	semi-enclosed basins, with various external forcings, ecosystem responses,
	feedbacks and potential impact on the sustainability of the fishery
	and economics. The obvious external forcings include freshwater runoff
	and other factors contributing to stratification, organic matter
	and nutrient loadings, as well as exchange between coastal and open
	ocean water masses. Their different interactions set up mechanisms
	that drive the system towards hypoxia. Coastal systems also vary
	in their relative susceptibility to hypoxia depending on their physical
	and geographic settings. It is understood that coastal hypoxia has
	a profound impact on the sustainability of ecosystems, which can
	be seen, for example, by the change in the food-web structure and
	system function; other influences include compression and loss of
	habitat, as well as changes in organism life cycles and reproduction.
	In most cases, the ecosystem responds to the low dissolved oxygen
	in non-linear ways with pronounced feedbacks to other compartments
	of the Earth System, including those that affect human society. Our
	knowledge and previous experiences illustrate that there is a need
	to develop new observational tools and models to support integrated
	research of biogeochemical dynamics and ecosystem behavior that will
	improve confidence in remediation management strategies for coastal
	hypoxia.},
